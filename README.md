# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze data accumulated from the Pyber ride sharing application and look for correlations between fare amounts and city types. This will help give us an uderstanding of the metrics in the types of cities that Pyber operates in. Visualizing this data could help Pyber make decisions that could have a positive impact to improve the access and affordability that customers have on the ride sharing service.
